# PowerStride

Harness the energy of your movement with PowerStride, a revolutionary wearable that converts kinetic energy from walking or running into electrical power, empowering you to charge devices and monetize the energy you generate.

## Introduction

PowerStride is at the forefront of wearable green technology, merging fitness with energy sustainability. Our innovative device captures the kinetic energy generated by everyday activities and transforms it into electrical energy that can be used to power devices, stored for later use, or even sold back as a sustainable energy source.

## Features

- **Energy Harvesting**: Utilize the power of your motion to generate electricity.
- **Efficient Storage**: Save your generated energy in a high-capacity battery for on-demand use.
- **Eco-Friendly**: Reduce your carbon footprint by using clean, renewable energy.
- **Monetization**: Convert your steps into profits by selling surplus energy.

## Quick Start

1. Attach PowerStride to your knee and connect it to the battery storage unit.
2. Begin your activity - walk, run, or jog to start generating power.
3. Monitor the charging status and battery levels using the PowerStride app.
4. Use the stored energy to charge your devices, or opt into our PowerStride network to sell your energy.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation on the PowerStride setup, operation, and troubleshooting can be found in the `/docs` directory.

## Description of Connections

1. **Generator to Booster**:
   - The output from the kinetic energy generator is connected to the input of the boost converter (booster). This setup steps up the voltage to a suitable level for charging the battery or powering devices.

2. **Booster to Battery**:
   - The output of the booster is connected to the battery, providing a regulated voltage to charge the battery safely.

3. **Battery to Arduino (for Monitoring)**:
   - A voltage divider is used to step down the battery voltage to a safe level below 5V, which is then connected to an analog input pin on the Arduino for battery voltage monitoring.

4. **Arduino to Booster (Control Signal)**:
   - If the booster has an enable pin or voltage control pin, it can be connected to a digital output pin on the Arduino. This allows the Arduino to control the booster based on the battery's charge status or other logic.

### Additional Notes:

- Ensure to include safety features like overcurrent protection, diode protection against backflow, and proper grounding.
- Use appropriate gauge wires for connections, especially for those carrying higher currents from the generator to the booster and from the booster to the battery.
